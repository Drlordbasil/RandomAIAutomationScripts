Welcome to my collection of experimental scripts. As someone with ADHD, my creative process is often driven by spontaneous bursts of inspiration, resulting in a diverse array of ideas. This repository serves as a sandbox for exploring various functions and techniques, ultimately contributing to larger, more complex projects.

Please note that most of these scripts have been tested locally on my Windows PC and are expected to function correctly. I am in the process of cleaning up my laptop and organizing files, so I will be removing any scripts that do not work as intended.

Feel free to explore and use these scripts as a resource for your own projects.




The requirements.txt is the output of my pip freeze sh command.
